Project Title: High-Profile University Learning Management System (LMS)

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend), PHP (Backend), MySQL (Database).

Quality Standard: High Security (SQL Injection protection), Professional UI/UX, Responsive Design.

1. core Architecture & Authentication

Database: Create a normalized MySQL database with tables for: Users (id, reg_no, password_hash, role, session, semester, personal_details), Courses, Enrollments, Assignments, Submissions, Grades, Attendance, and Finance.

Authentication:

Create a Login/Register page.

Registration: Users (Student/Instructor) enter a Registration ID. This ID must pre-exist in the database (added by Admin). If the ID matches and has no account yet, allow them to set a password.

Login: Validate Registration ID + Password.

Security: Use password_hash() (Bcrypt) for storage. NO plain text passwords. Use PHP Prepared Statements ($stmt->prepare) strictly to prevent SQL Injection.

Routing: Redirect based on Role:

Student $\to$ student_dashboard.php

Instructor $\to$ instructor_dashboard.php

Admin $\to$ admin_dashboard.php

2. Admin Dashboard (The Controller)

Bulk Management: Instead of manual entry, allow the Admin to upload a CSV file to bulk-create Student and Instructor placeholders (Reg No, Name, Session, Semester).

Scheduling: Admin sets the "Master Schedule" (Subject, Room, Time, Instructor) for each Semester/Session.

Finance Control: Admin can update fee status.

Security: Admin login does not need IP restriction, but must have a robust session timeout implementation.

3. Student Dashboard (The Viewer)

Profile Header: Display Name (S/o, D/o), DOB, Admission Date, Session.

UX Feature - Fee Banner: If fee_status == 'unpaid', display a sticky Red Alert Bar at the top of the dashboard (dismissible for the session, but reappears on refresh). Include a "Download Voucher" button.

Schedule: Read from the database based on the student's current Semester/Session.

Notes: View/Download list of files uploaded by the instructor.

Assignments:

List pending assignments.

Upload Feature: Allow file upload (PDF/Docx) before the due_date. Disable upload button if current_time > due_date.

Grades:

Show a table of grades per subject.

Show a "Result Summary" at the bottom (CGPA/Total Marks).

Attendance: Read from the MySQL Attendance table (display as a progress bar or percentage).

4. Instructor Dashboard (The Manager)

Schedule: specific to the instructor.

Assignments Manager:

Create Assignment (Title, Description, File, Due Date, Class).

Grading Interface: View list of student submissions. Input marks.

Alert: Show a notification: "You have X unchecked assignments for [Subject Name]."

Notes Manager: Upload lecture slides/notes for specific classes.

Grading Module (Advanced):

Allow creating a "Grading Policy" (e.g., Quiz: 10%, Mid: 25%, Final: 50%).

CSV Import: Allow Instructor to upload a CSV (format: RegNo, Marks) to auto-fill grades for the whole class to match the complexity of typical university grading sheets (Theory vs. Lab).

5. Design & Logic Requirements

Frontend: Use a clean, professional CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind) or custom CSS that looks "Corporate/University" style (Whites, Blues, Greys).

Logic:

Ensure file uploads rename files to prevent conflicts (e.g., studentID_assignmentID.pdf).

Attendance should not rely on Google Sheets. Build a simple interface where the Instructor checks boxes for "Present/Absent" and saves to MySQL
